                        My life's work is to teach people, particularly children, that good dental hygine is of paramount importance.
                        Besides the fact that a mouth full of funky green snaggle teeth doesn't look atractive:
                       <br>
                      Recent studies have found
                      that gingivitius is at least linked to, and may cause, Alzhimers desease.   So, neglect your teeth at the risk of
                      forgetting who you are..

                <div id="biography-rest">
                    This line of work involves a lot of travel and visits to schools which are fun, although the children can get clingy
                    at times.
                    <br>
                    The worst part of my job is that I also have to visit the dentist quite often.  Sometimes 4-5 times in a single day!
